"""Evaluates all the tests that live in `scss/tests/files`.

A test is any file with a `.scss` extension.  It'll be compiled, and the output
will be compared to the contents of a file named `foo.css`.

Currently, test files must be nested exactly one directory below `files/`.
This limitation is completely arbitrary.
