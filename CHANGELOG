Changelog
=========

2.0.0 ???
    + Heavy refactoring, an expanded test suite, and more extensibility.

    + Bug fixes and missing SCSS features:
        + Unrecognized @-rule blocks such as ``@keyframes`` are now preserved.
        + ``@media`` blocks aren't repeated for every rule inside.
        + Dashes and underscores are treated as interchangeable in variable, function, and mixin names.
	+ Rule blocks in the form ``background: red { ... }`` are now supported.
	+ Pound-interpolation always drops quotes on strings.
	+ Colors are output as their shortest representation, and never as ``hsl()``.
	+ Color names in strings and selectors are no longer replaced with hex equivalents.
	+ Unrecognized units are now left intact.
	+ Arbitrary combinations of units (e.g., ``px * px``) are supported for intermediate values.  Unit cancellation now works reliably.
	+ Comparison and addition are now more in line with the Ruby behavior.
	+ Single quoted strings no longer lose their quotes on output.
	+ ``/`` is now left untouched when it appears between literals.
	+ Several Compass functions now adhere more closely to Compass's behavior.  ``linear-gradient()`` is less likely to wreck valid CSS3 syntax.
	+ ``null`` is supported.

    + New features:
        + Support for writing custom Sass functions in Python.
        + Added ``background-brushed``.

    + Backwards-incompatible changes:
        + Configuration via monkeypatching the ``scss`` module no longer works.  Use the new constructor arguments instead.
	+ ``em`` and ``px`` are no longer interchangeable.
	+ Unrecognized variable names are now a fatal error.

    + Internals:
	+ Parsing now produces an AST rather than evaluating as it goes, fixing some cache bugs.
	+ Type system largely overhauled, with less support for acting like Python values but more predictable behavior overall.

1.1.5 Feb 15, 2013
    + ``debug_info`` now properly produces rules that can be used by FireSass and Google Chrome SASS Source Maps.
    + Improved memory usage for large sets of files to be used as sprites.
    + Warns about IE 4095 maximum number of selectors.
    + ``debug_info`` prints info as comments if specified as ``comments``.
    + Better handling of undefined variables.
    + Added CSS filter functions and ``skewX`` ``skewY``.
    + Command line tool and entry point fixed.
    + Fix cache buster URLs when paths already include queries or fragments.
    + Hashable Values.

1.1.4 Aug 8, 2012
    + Added ``--debug-info`` command line option (for *FireSass* output).
    + Added compass helper function ``reject()``.
    + Added ``undefined`` keyword for undefined variables.

1.1.3 Jan 9, 2012
    + Support for the new Sass 3.2.0 features (``@content`` and placeholder selectors)
    + Fixed bug with line numbers throwing an exception.

1.1.2 Jan 3, 2012
    + Regression bug fixed from 1.1.1

1.1.1 Jan 2, 2012
    + Added optional C speedup module for an amazing boost in scanning speed!
    + Added ``headings``, ``stylesheet-url``, ``font-url``, ``font-files``, ``inline-font-files`` and ``sprite-names``.

1.1.0 - Dec 22, 2011
    + Added ``min()`` and ``max()`` for lists.
    + Removed exception raise.

1.0.9 - Dec 22, 2011
    + Optimizations in the scanner.
    + Added ``background-noise()`` for compass-recipes support.
    + ``enumerate()`` and ``range()`` can go backwards. Ex.: ``range(3, 0)`` goes from 3 to 0.
    + Added line numbers and files for errors.
    + Added support for *Firebug* with *FireSass*.
    + ``nth(n)`` is round (returns the ``nth mod len`` item of the list).
    + ``--watch`` added to the command line.
    + Several bugs fixed.

1.0.8 - May 13, 2011
    + Changed source color (``$src-color``) default to black.
    + Moved the module filename to ``__init__.py`` and module renamed back to scss.
